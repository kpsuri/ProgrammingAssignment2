## Description: The following functions create and cache a matrix and its inverse. Also,
## compute its inverse if it does not exist already and 
## set it in cache for subsequent usage.


## makeCacheMatrix function: 
##      Sets (in cache) or gets a special matrix. 
##      It also sets (in cache) or gets the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) 
{

}



## cacheSolve function:
##      Checks to see if inverse of given matrix exists, if yes, is retrieved
##      If not, computes the inverse of the matrix and sets it in cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) 
{
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
